# anki-japanese-deck-creator
I got sick of downloading other peoples subpar japanese anki vocab decks so I've created scripts which automatically parse a list of japanese words and turn them into a csv file which can be imported into anki as a deck. The vocab lists I personally use come from tanos.co.uk and I use the jisho.org api to look up definitions
