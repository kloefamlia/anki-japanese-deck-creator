# anki-japanese-deck-creator
I got sick of downloading other peoples subpar japanese anki vocab decks so I've created scripts which automatically parse a list of japanese words and turn them into a csv file which can be imported into anki as a deck. The vocab lists I personally use come from tanos.co.uk and I use the jisho.org api to look up definitions

TODO:
-make a basic back creater (using the syntax i definied)
-map the english parts of speech definitions to their japanese counter-parts
-think of and list possible exceptions
-handle the esp. (some kanji) definitions
-handle when different defs of the same word are different parts of speech
-most of the exceptions seem to be verbs and adverbs so maybe seperate those somehow?
